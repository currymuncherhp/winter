# Project Forest Keyboard

## Summary

I will be building a custom mechanical keyboard. It would be a keyboard I would use in my day to day life. I want to build it because I have been interested in building a keyboard for about a year now, but have never acquired the funds for it. I am excited to build it because I want a fun project that I would actually be using on a day to day basis. For this project I will be trying to make a green themed keyboard because green is my favorite color. However I will be making it a subtle green color such as a forest green. 

## Plan

First I would take the GMMK kit and assemble it into a frame. I may also take some foam pieces that I have laying around to insert it in the frame so the acoustics sound better. Then I would take the Akko switches and inserting them into the board. I would then take the set of keycaps and place them accordingly on the board.
